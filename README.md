# 30-days-of-code-hackerrank-challenge
This is the repository created for 30 Days of Code Hacker-rank Challenge.

# Day 0
To complete this challenge, you must save a line of input from stdin to a variable, print Hello, World. on a single line, and finally print the value of your variable on a second line. For more detailed inputs and outputs, go through this link

# Day 1
The variables , and  are already declared and initialized for you. You must:

Declare  variables: one of type int, one of type double, and one of type String. <br/>
Read  lines of input from stdin (according to the sequence given in the Input Format section below) and initialize your  variables.<br/>
Use the  operator to perform the following operations: <br/>
Print the sum of  plus your int variable on a new line. <br/>
Print the sum of  plus your double variable to a scale of one decimal place on a new line. <br/>
Concatenate  with the string you read as input and print the result on a new line. <br/>

# Day 2
Given the meal price (base cost of a meal), tip percent (the percentage of the meal price being added as tip), and tax percent (the percentage of the meal price being added as tax) for a meal, find and print the meal's total cost. Round the result to the nearest integer. <br/>

# Day 3
Given an integer, n , perform the following conditional actions: <br/>

If n is odd, print Weird <br/>
If n is even and in the inclusive range of 2 to 5, print Not Weird <br/>
If n is even and in the inclusive range of 6 to 20, print Weird <br/>
If n is even and greater than 20, print Not Weird <br/>

# Day 4
Write a Person class with an instance variable, age, and a constructor that takes an integer, initialAge, as a parameter. The constructor must assign initialAge  to age  after confirming the argument passed as initialAge is not negative; if a negative argument is passed as initialage , the constructor should set to and print Age is not valid, setting age to 0.

# Day 5
Given an integer,n , print its first 10 multiples. Each multiple  (where ) should be printed on a new line in the form: n x i = result.

# Day 6
Given a string, S , of length N  that is indexed from 0 to N-1 , print its even-indexed and odd-indexed characters as 2 space-separated strings on a single line (see the Sample below for more detail). <br/>
